# What is this?

A package that provides generics for creating your own commit log. 
A *commit log* is a generic data-structure that holds an ordered & prioritized list of `Commit` objects. How information is stored in a
commit log is user defined.


### Example Use Cases

##### Allowing In-app purchases and AB tests to co-exist.
Let's say you have an app has both IAP non-consumables and AB tests.  Imagine you also have a consumable named `foo` which affects property `zir`.  Then you also have an AB test named `bar` which affects property `zir` and `zim`.

##### Managing IAP subscriptions
You have an app that relies on subscriptions for a subset to enable a subset of features.  You need to make sure a subscription is valid and have a way of checking whether the subscription has expired.

## Example

### Step 1
Let's start with a user object.  We embed the `lz CommitLog` structure into our `User` model:

```go
type User struct {
  // SQL Zone
  Name string
  Age int
  
  // Some other data-store (e.g. Redis)
  PeopleViewingMe []People

  lz commitlog.CommitLog
}
```

### Step 2
For each `struct` **definition** (**i.e. not instance level, class level**), you will need to create an `LZArena` and add a set of zones.

```go
// Create an LZArena to store our zone operations
var UserArena = NewLZArena()

// Add our zones to the arena
var UserSQLZone = UserArena.AddZone(LZops{
  Fetch: func (obj {}interface) {
    u := obj.(*User)
    SqlQueryToGetNameAndAge(u)
  },
  Flush: func (obj {}interface, tags []string) error {
	u := obj.(*User)

  StartSQLTransaction()
  
  for _, tag := range tags {
   switch tag {
     case 'name':
       UpdateNameViaSQL(u)
     case 'age':
       UpdateAgeViaSQL(u)
   }
  }

  // If commit fails, it will return an error
  err := CommitSQLTransaction()
  return err
})

var UserRedisZone = UserArena.AddZone(LZops{
  Fetch: func (obj {}interface) {
    u := obj.(*User)
    RedisQueryToGetPeopleViewingMe()
  },
  Flush: func (obj {}interface, tags []string) {
	u := obj.(*User)
	Panic("unsupported")
  },
})

func NewUser() *User {
  u := &User{}
  
  //Ensure lz is initiatilized
  u.lz.Init(UserArena, u)
}
```

### Step 3

##### Getters
For your applicable getters on your model, you need to add a `Fetch` before attempting to read from the model.  This `Fetch` call won't do anything if the data was previously fetched but not dirty.

```go
func (u *User) GetName() string {
  // Will only call once if zone is not fetched. Sets state to clean.
  u.lz.Fetch(UserSQLZone)
}
```

##### Setters
For your applicable setters on your model, you need to note that a zone has been dirtied. You can add 'tags' which
will be available in your flush routine so you can update only the fields that have changed.

```go
func (u *User) SetName(name string) string {
  u.lz.SetDirty(UserSQLZone, "name")
  
  u.Name = name
}
```

### Step 4 
Now your ready to call `err := u.lz.Flush()` when you're ready to save all dirty changes. If any of the zones fails to flush (zone flush ops returns error), then this will return the first error and not complete the flush.
